# Installation
I recommend using Pipenv in order to execute this code. 
Intall it in your Python main installation with `pip install pipenv`

Then, you only need to execute `pipenv install .` in the folder where this code is placed. 
Run the code with `pipenv run python geojson_comparator.py`. Enjoy.

# Usage
In case you need to use KML files there is a parser in data called `conversor2geojson.py` you only 
have to change the PATH in main rutine.

To use `geojson_comparator.py` you only have to change the PATH to your GeoJSON in the main 
rutine to compare with the original data.
